These are the exercises for the **Introduction to Gradle Build Tool for Developers**
training course, for a C++ audience that uses Groovy DSL. They are designed to give
you hands-on experience during the live training to get you going on your journey.

The exercises are progressive, each one building upon the previous. You can
continue to use the same workspace throughout the exercises.

These exercises were contributed by the `Xilinx` team at `AMD`. Special thanks to
[`Prema Sai Kumar Reddy Gangana`](https://github.com/premgangana-xlnx) for the
contributions.
